HOW TO ADD TO YOUR SITE:
-------------------------

1. Upload these NEW files to your website:
   - blog.html
   - blog-styles.css
   - blog-script.js
   - blog-posts.js
   - generate-blog.py
   - blog-posts/ folder with markdown files

2. Add a link to the blog in your navbar (in components.js):
   <a href="blog.html">Blog</a>

3. Done! The blog will automatically:
   - Use your existing navbar
   - Use your existing footer
   - Match your site's color scheme
   - Work with your existing scripts


WEEKLY WORKFLOW (unchanged):
-----------------------------

1. Create: blog-posts/2026-02-03-new-post.md
2. Run: python generate-blog.py
3. Upload: blog-posts.js (regenerated)
4. Your new post is live!


WHAT STAYS THE SAME:
---------------------

✓ Your existing pages (index.html, search.html, etc.) - NO CHANGES
✓ Your existing styles (style.css) - NO CHANGES
✓ Your existing scripts (components.js, main.js) - NO CHANGES
✓ Your navbar and footer - NO CHANGES
✓ All existing functionality - NO CHANGES

The blog simply ADDS to your site without modifying anything existing.


CUSTOMIZATION:
--------------

Blog-specific colors are in blog-styles.css and match your existing:
--main-blue: #051650
--dark-green: #3D7068
--light-green: #eefbf2
--light-blue: #6279B8
--accent: #EA9E8D

To change blog colors, edit the :root variables in blog-styles.css.
The navbar/footer colors are controlled by your existing style.css.


TESTING:
--------

After uploading, test:
1. Navigate to yoursite.com/blog.html
2. Check navbar appears (should match other pages)
3. Check footer appears (should match other pages)
4. Click a blog post to read it
5. Click "Back to Blog" button
6. Test on mobile (hamburger menu should work)
7. Test dark mode toggle (bottom left button)


TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------

If navbar doesn't appear:
→ Check scripts/components.js is loading
→ Check console for JavaScript errors

If footer doesn't appear:
→ Check scripts/components.js is loading
→ Check footer-placeholder div is present

If posts don't show:
→ Check blog-posts.js is loaded
→ Run generate-blog.py to regenerate
→ Check console for errors

If styles look wrong:
→ Check both style.css and blog-styles.css are loading
→ Clear browser cache
→ Check file paths are correct
