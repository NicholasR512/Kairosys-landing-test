## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Logos Not Appearing
**Possible Causes:**
1. File paths are incorrect (check case-sensitivity)
2. Logo files don't exist in the `Logo/` folder
3. JavaScript file not loaded properly

**Solution:**
- Open browser console (F12) and check for errors

### Issue: Logos Too Small/Large
**Solution:**
- Adjust `.logo-item` height in CSS
- Adjust `.logo-item img` max-width in CSS
