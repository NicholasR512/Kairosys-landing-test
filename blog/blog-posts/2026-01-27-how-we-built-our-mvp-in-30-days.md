## The Challenge

When we set out to build our minimum viable product, we knew we had a tight deadline. Investors were waiting, early adopters were eager, and we had to move fast without compromising quality.

The key was ruthless prioritization. We identified the absolute core features that would validate our hypothesis and cut everything else. No bells, no whistles—just the essential functionality that would let users solve their problem.

## Our Approach

We adopted a sprint-based methodology, breaking down the 30 days into six 5-day sprints. Each sprint had a clear goal and deliverable. The team worked in pairs, constantly reviewing each other's work to maintain quality while moving quickly.

### Key Decisions

We made several critical decisions that helped us stay on track:

- **Use existing tools** - We leveraged open-source libraries and proven frameworks
- **Focus on core value** - Every feature had to answer: "Does this validate our hypothesis?"
- **Daily standups** - 15-minute check-ins kept everyone aligned
- **Ship early, iterate** - Perfect is the enemy of done

## The Results

On day 30, we had a working product. It wasn't perfect, but it was functional, and most importantly, it solved the problem we set out to solve. We immediately put it in front of users and started gathering feedback.

The MVP approach taught us that **done is better than perfect**. The feedback we received in the first week was worth more than any amount of internal planning could have provided.

## Key Takeaways

1. Speed matters in startups, but speed with purpose matters more
2. User feedback beats internal assumptions every time
3. Technical debt is okay if it helps you learn faster
4. The MVP is just the beginning of the journey

What we built in 30 days was good enough to learn from, and that learning is what has guided every decision since. Ship early, learn fast, iterate constantly.
