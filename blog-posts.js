You need to check FDA 510(k) clearances, search MAUDE reports for adverse events, study PubMed articles, look through USPTO patents, and maybe check social media for user complaints. Each database has its own interface, its own search logic, and its own limitations.</p>\n\n<p>A regulatory consultant working on a continuous glucose monitor, for example, might spend hours across several different databases just to understand what's already been cleared, what problems users are reporting, and what IP exists in the space. The data is all public but fragmented.</p>\n\n<h2>What PIP Does</h2>\n\n<p>PIP (Product Improvement Platform) searches across multiple medical device databases from one interface: FDA 510(k) clearances, PMA approvals, MAUDE adverse event reports, PubMed articles, USPTO patents, Reddit discussions, and client data you upload.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of logging into several different websites and running separate searches, you search once and get results from all sources. Beyond returning raw results, PIP summarizes actionable insights within each data source, highlights recurring issues and signals, and connects patterns across regulatory filings, adverse events, patents, and user feedback. Unlike general-purpose GenAI tools, PIP is built specifically for medical device development based on traceable inputs to help reduce hallucinations and unsupported outputs.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://www.kairosysai.com/imgs/CGM_Maude_02022025.png\" alt=\"PIP MAUDE Analysis\" />\n\n<p>Based on talking to over 50 professionals, we aim to help teams take on more projects by accelerating ideation and decision-making, identifying risks early to avoid redesigns, strengthening early documentation to reduce regulatory friction and overly conservative designs, and lowering cognitive load so teams don't spend costly hours re-hashing what they already know.</p>\n\n<h2>Vision</h2>\n\n<p>Right now, PIP handles search, aggregation, and cross-source insight generation. We're working on search expansion, more specific results, key opinion leader data collection, and smarter methods of revealing actionable connections between regulatory data and real-world device performance. Our goal is to make the entire process of medical device discovery and design more comprehensive, efficient, and user-centered.</p>\n\n<h2>Partnership with Eliomedica</h2>\n\n<p>Eliomedica works with medtech companies of all stages on regulatory affairs, go-to-market strategy, and R&D. Eliomedica brings regulatory expertise and real use cases; KairoSys is building innovative discovery and design infrastructure. Together, we're improving workflows and saving clients' time and hassle.</p>\n\n<h2>Free Licenses</h2>\n\n<p>As a limited time offer, we're providing a limited number of free PIP licenses to medical device professionals who want to improve their workflows and give us feedback to improve ours. If you work in regulatory affairs, clinical or human factors engineering, product development, or frequently search FDA and patent databases, contact us at: <a href=\"https://www.kairosysai.com/#contact\">https://www.kairosysai.com/#contact</a>. Include what you're working on and what you'd search for, and we'll help you get started. Happy building!</p>",
